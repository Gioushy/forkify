# Forkify Project

The Forkify app is a web-based recipe search and management application developed as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy. Forkify is designed to help users discover, save, and manage recipes from a vast database. It leverages modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with integration with a third-party API to fetch recipe data dynamically.
Key Features:
• Recipe Search: The app allows users to search for recipes by entering keywords or ingredients.
• Recipe Display: It displays recipes with images, titles, and other relevant information retrieved from an external API.
• Recipe Details: Users can view detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking time.
• Bookmarking: The app enables users to bookmark their favorite recipes for quick access later.
• Shopping List: Users can add ingredients from recipes to a shopping list feature, making it convenient for planning and purchasing ingredients.
• Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
• Modern JavaScript Practices: Throughout the project, modern JavaScript practices such as ES6 syntax, modules, and asynchronous programming may have been implemented.
• API Integration: The project demonstrates integration with a third-party API to fetch recipe data dynamically.
• Error Handling: The app likely includes error handling mechanisms to handle cases such as network errors or invalid user input.
• Local Storage: It may use browser local storage to store user preferences, such as bookmarked recipes or shopping lists, persistently.
